## What you'll learn

- Core principles behind scalable, reliable, and costâ€‘effective systems
- Tradeâ€‘offs in architecture decisions (latency vs. throughput, consistency vs. availability)
- Practical patterns for caching, messaging, storage, and resiliency
- How to read and reason about diagrams and productionâ€‘grade topologies

## How to use this repo

- Start from the overview pages to understand the problem space and common patterns.
- Dive into topic pages (caching, queues, databases, compute, networking) for deeper explanations.
- Explore diagrams under `public/` and linked in the docs to visualize reference architectures.
- Follow links to external authoritative readings to broaden your understanding.

## Topics roadmap

- Foundations: scalability, reliability, observability
- Data: OLTP vs. OLAP, sharding, replication, indexing
- Caching: client/server, CDN, cache invalidation, TTL strategies
- Messaging: queues, streams, exactlyâ€‘once vs. atâ€‘leastâ€‘once semantics
- Compute: autoscaling, containers, serverless, background jobs
- Networking: load balancers, service meshes, rate limiting, backpressure
- Resilience: retries, circuit breakers, bulkheads, chaos testing
